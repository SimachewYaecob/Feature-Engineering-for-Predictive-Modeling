**Feature Engineering**

•	Project Title: Feature Engineering for Predictive Modeling

•	Description: Select a dataset and perform feature engineering to improve model performance. Create new features, select important ones, and evaluate their impact.

•	Dataset Reference: Kaggle House Prices Dataset

### **Steps Involved in the Project:**

1. **Dataset Selection:**
   - Choose a dataset that involves predicting a continuous target variable, such as housing prices, sales forecasts, or stock prices.
   - From the **housing price dataset**, the target variable is `price`, and the predictors include features like **area**, **bedrooms**, **bathrooms**, **stories**, and **parking**.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - **Create new features**: Generate features that can capture more information:
     - **Price per square meter**: `price / area`
     - **Total rooms**: Sum of `bedrooms` and `bathrooms`
     - **Area per bedroom**: `area / bedrooms`
     - **Price per bedroom**: `price / bedrooms`
   - **Interaction features**: Combine two or more features to capture interactions. For example:
     - Interaction between `area` and `stories`.
     - Interaction between `bathrooms` and `bedrooms`.
   - **Categorical Encoding**: Convert categorical features (if any) into numerical values using techniques like One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding.

4. **Feature Selection:**
   - **Importance Ranking**: Identify which features have the most predictive power by using feature importance methods such as:
     - **Random Forest** feature importance.
     - **XGBoost** feature importance.
   - **Correlation Matrix**: Identify highly correlated features to avoid multicollinearity. Features that are highly correlated can be dropped or combined.

5. **Model Building and Evaluation:**
   - **Baseline Model**: I Start with simple models like **Random Forest** to check the initial performance (RMSE).
   - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: I apply **GridSearchCV** techniques to fine-tune hyperparameters and improve model performance.
   - **Ensemble Methods**: Consider using ensemble models like **XGBoost** to leverage different learning approaches and improve performance.

6. **Model Performance Metrics:**
   - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** is the primary metric to evaluate model performance, and the goal is to minimize it.

**Insights and Conclusion**

1.	Feature engineering plays a crucial role in improving model performance by creating new features, selecting important ones, and transforming existing ones. The goal of this project is to enhance the predictive power of models, such as Random Forest and XGBoost, through the creation and selection of informative features. The ultimate aim is to reduce the model's Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), a metric that quantifies the difference between predicted and actual values.
2.	The initial Random Forest(1,401,496.84) model is not very good, indicating that there is room for improvement. This could be due to the lack of feature engineering or an insufficient selection of important features. After performing feature engineering (such as creating new features like price per square meter, total rooms, and interaction terms), the model's performance significantly improved. The RMSE(574,881.11) is reduced by more than half, which is a strong indication that feature engineering was beneficial.
3.	RMSE(545,522.79) After Feature Engineering (XGBoost): The XGBoost model performed slightly better than Random Forest after feature engineering.
4.	RMSE(431,991.63) After Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV): Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV led to further improvements in RMSE. This indicates that the model could still benefit from tuning the hyperparameters, such as tree depth, learning rate, or regularization parameters.
